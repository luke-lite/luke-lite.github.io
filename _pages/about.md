My name is Luke DiPerna. I'm a data guy with a background in education, literature, and athletics. I have taught students from as young as 18 months to as old as 72, I used to coach high school football and basketball, and I spent several years researching and writing about postmoden American literature. After all of that, I decided to pursue a career in a long-time passion of mine: data.
