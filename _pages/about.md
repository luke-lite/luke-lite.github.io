My name is Luke DiPerna. I'm a data guy with a background in education, literature, and athletics. I have taught students from as young as 18 months to as old as 72, I used to coach high school football and basketball, and I spent several years of my life researching and writing about postmoden American literature. After all of that, I finally decided to pursue a career in a long-time passion of mine: data.

I have experience working with a large variety of data analytics and data science tools, the results of which can be found on this site. 

For a look at some of the end-to-end data science projects I have built, including a bank fraud detection machine-learning algorithm that accounts for bias and discrimination, click [here]
